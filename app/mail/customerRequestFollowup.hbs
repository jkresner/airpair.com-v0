If you have any useful feedback for airpair (e.g. to improve the experience or for PR ammunition) please drop it in a reply to this email. Please include feedback on your expert {name here} to help them build credibility for other customers to see.

Is there anything else we can help you with? Many customers buy 5-20 hour packages that they use to check in with experts once or twice a week. We're currently running a special - $10 discount for every hour in your package (so up to $200 off a 20 hour pkg).

Lastly are you on angellist? If so would it be ok to list you as a customer on our profile?
