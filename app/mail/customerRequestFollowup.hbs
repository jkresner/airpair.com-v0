If you have any useful feedback for AirPair (e.g. to improve the experience or for PR ammunition) please drop it in a reply to this email. Please include feedback on your expert, {name here}, to help them build credibility for other customers to see.

Is there anything else we can help you with? Many customers have started turbo-boosting their development velocity by buying 5-20 hour packages that they use to check in with experts once or twice a week to avoid rabbit holes and embrace best practices and architectures.

Lastly, are you on AngelList? If so would it be OK to list you as a customer on our profile?
