-- Private Welcome with Customer

Hey @@, welcome to our private HipChat IM network. We use asynchronous instant messaging to connect you with our experts and help you schedule times for your AirPair sessions. Let me know when you've found your way in here, so I can explain to you next steps.

-- Ok with hangouts

Also we just want to double check you are ok with google hangouts? We use them record all sessions, so that you have it for reference and can refer to your session later in case you miss something the experts explains. Here are some example open source sessions we've done recently:

-- Welcome arbitrary length

@HassanAjan & @JamesGill welcome to your private HipChat room! Use this room to agree on a schedule time & length (1 or 2 hours) of your AirPair. HipChat is asy  nchronous chat, so even if the other person isn't in the room, message each other here and not via email. If you want to get another person's attention when they are not in the room, @ reference their name and they will get an email notification. HipChat is a great place for pre-session questions and post session conversation + sharing links & resources. If you have any unanswered questions about the AirPair process feel free to drop them in here too.

-- Archiving Room
@all hope everything is well. Going to archive @customer request off our dashboard and mark as completed. Please let me know if you need any further help from @expert.

This room is also going to be archived and left for 4 weeks before it being automatically deleted. Unfortunately HipChat hasn't scaled for our use case and we need to regularly clean up after ourselves to keep it functional.
