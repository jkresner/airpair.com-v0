We've got your {{tagsString}} request and will start looking for experts as soon as we get a reply to this email. Are you ready to jump on an airpair this week? We only begin reaching out to our expert network for you once you're 100 percent ready. Do you have any idea how many hours you'd like to book? Ok if you don't, but if you do it will guide us to find an expert with matching availability.

Also we just want to double check you are ok with google hangouts? We use them record all sessions, so that you have it for reference and can refer to your session later in case you miss something the experts explains. Here are some example open source sessions we've done recently:

Finally, how did you hear about us?

Looking forward to working together!
