We've got a match! {insert name} has agreed to jump on airpair.

Once you have a time, I'll send you a google calendar
invite so you have it in your diary. Please confirm the
 time appears correct in your timezone and then accept the invitation.

Be ready 10 minutes before your call. We hard finish on the hour so as not to affect customers after you. A few minutes before your airpair, someone from our team will invite you to a google hangout to record your session. We record sessions so you can watch them back anytime in case you miss something the expert explains to you.
