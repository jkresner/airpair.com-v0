@HassanAjan & @JamesGill welcome to your private hipchat room! Use this room to agree on a schedule time & length (1 or 2 hours) of your airpair. Hipchat is asynchronous chat, so even if the other person isn't in the room, message each other here and not via email. If you want to get another persons attention when they are not in the room, @ reference their name and they will get an email notification. Hip chat is a great place for pre-session questions and post session conversation + sharing links & resources. If you have any unanswered questions about the airpair process feel free to drop them in here too.

Lastly, your session is an open source session, meaning we share the content publicly with our community. If either of you have any issues with that, please let me know asap.

What comes next?
