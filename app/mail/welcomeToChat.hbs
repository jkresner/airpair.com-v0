Private Chat with Customer
===================================================

Hello {Customer name}, hope to see you in HipChat soon. Please reply to the email we just sent from team@airpair.com if you have any trouble finding your way in here.

How did you hear about us?

--

We only begin reaching out to our expert network for you once you're 100 percent ready. Do you have any idea how many hours you'd like to book? Ok if you don't, but if you do it will guide us to find an expert with matching availability.

--

Also we just want to double check you are ok with google hangouts? We use them record all sessions, so that you have it for reference and can refer to your session later in case you miss something the experts explains. Here are some example open source sessions we've done recently:

@HassanAjan & @JamesGill welcome to your private HipChat room! Use this room to agree on a schedule time & length (1 or 2 hours) of your AirPair. HipChat is asynchronous chat, so even if the other person isn't in the room, message each other here and not via email. If you want to get another person's attention when they are not in the room, @ reference their name and they will get an email notification. HipChat is a great place for pre-session questions and post session conversation + sharing links & resources. If you have any unanswered questions about the AirPair process feel free to drop them in here too.
