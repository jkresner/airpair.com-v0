<h2>What an AirPair looks like</h2>

<p style="font-style:italic;font-size:12px">"My first experience with airpair was amazing. I'm working on a RubyMotion app at work and airpair found me an expert within a day. We were able to work through the major hurdle that caused me to seek help within the first hour. You can see us get a UPC scanner running & the source code is at <a href="//github.com/markrickert/RubymotionUPC-example" target="_blank">https://github.com/markrickert/RubymotionUPC-example</a>. A+++++ Would pair again." <b>Ross Furhman</b></p>
