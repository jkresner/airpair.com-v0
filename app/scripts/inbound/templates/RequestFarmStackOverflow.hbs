Hi {{firstname}},<br><br>

I'm Jonathon. I recently started a pair programming community called AirPair to support devs learning new tech or stuck on complex problems. I see that you're a top answer for {{tag}} questions on Stack Overflow (awesome).<br><br>

We have a member <a href="{{requesturl}}">wanting to learn how to {{problem}} and ready to pay ${{rate}}/hr</a> for 1-2 hours of expert guidance over video chat/ screen sharing.<br><br>

The concept works well and being a pair programming expert myself (I like helping folks with backbone.js), I promise it is really fun teaching people things and getting them un-stuck. We did a session a couple of weeks ago on WordPress debugging where I found Eric Mann (a top answerer for WordPress on SO) the same way I'm reaching out to you and you can <a href="https://twitter.com/EricMann/status/398678439219040258">see him tweet</a> about how much he enjoyed it. He even <a href="http://www.airpair.com/wordpress/expert-help-eric-mann">wrote a blog post about his experience</a> for us.<br><br>

Would love to know if this is something you're keen to try?<br><br>
