        <p>An <b>airpair</b> is a personalized remote screen sharing session between an entrepreneur & an expert developer.</p>

He patiently explained some arcane aspects of Node and cemented the abstract tutorials I had done to real-world examples. Peter followed up the sessions with outlines and code examples--I didn't expect that and really appreciate it now that I'm writing new code. Perhaps the most valuable result is that I now know that my project's overall re-design has been vetted by a professional.</p>

        Peter was great. I had been researching options for a week and had distilled things down to a few pain points and specific questions. His answers were concrete. It was gratifying to hear that the parts I felt were "wrong" to me were the parts he had good alternative suggestions for.

        <p class="feedback"><b>David Crawford:</b> Overall I had a good experience and got answers much faster than I could on my own. I learned a lot and got my money's worth. I was impressed with how quickly Alex understood my architecture and specific challenges.  It's not particularly complicated, but I've encountered a lot of good engineers who can take a while to catch on to a verbal description of how a technology works.  Alex's could be very productive in this session because he could understand my application so quickly.
        Overall, I would use the service again, especially if I was confident that I was talking to someone with experience running production systems with similar challenges to mine.</p>

        <p class="feedback"><b>Alexandru Vladutu: </b>It's been a great session with David, I think we've covered some
ground in an hour and I'm really pleased with that.

Besides the awesome feeling you have with helping someone (maybe
you've experienced being helped or helping someone on stackoverflow so
you know how it's like), having a video talk is definitely more
productive, as you can share code / tips & tricks and also answer new
questions along the way.

It's the first time I did this and it's been really interesting, I
would do it again if I had the chance.</p>

        <p><b>Jonathon Kresner: </b> I started airpair to help entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p class="feedback">I've ALWAYS loved coding product. When things run smooth & you're knocking out screens, life is grand. But often teams loose their way. Products get delayed and instead of knowing if your market assumptions are right, you're stuck battling technology. I know because I was their in both of my first startups. I needed access to mobile experts and db gurus, even though I consider myself a strong engineer.</p>

        <p class="feedback">airpair is for companies that want to get back on track, or better start off on the right foot and periodically get expert help to deliver faster than they could on their own.</p>

          one of the many companies I've worked for, there were pitfalls and time spent
          that could have been avoided. I want to empower founders to be less restrained
          from battling technology and more empowered to focus on driving people to their
          products and winning customers.</p> -->
