        p Hey ________________,

        p We're in the process of launching one of the world's first large scale virtual conferences. We already have a bunch of notable speakers covering everything from Agile to Programming and UX design. Many of them are successful software entrepreneurs, bloggers and popular open-source contributors. However... we can do better.

        p We think there's a lot more expert talent out waiting to shine, and that's where you come in to the picture. We think you can give the hidden gems of your community a chance to shine in front of a worldwide audience.

        p The link to our AirConf Call for Presentations (CFP) is http://bit.ly/airconf-cfp  -- please share it directly with experts in your group, especially women and minorities.

        p Below is a general announcement email you can forward out to the entire group. It has a unique promo code just for your group's members.

        p Thanks in advance for your help and feel free to hit me up with any questions that I can answer about the event.

        p Best,
        = promo.owner

        p Unlike most conferences, you're not going to need to book a flight or hotel room. It's 100% online. You're also not going to need to block out a few days from your calendar. The conference is scheduled from August 4th - 31st, and you can join the workshops that you're interested in (plus watch replays of the ones you can't attend live).

        p
          strong #{promo.organization} has a limited number of promo codes for #{promo.offer} registration.
