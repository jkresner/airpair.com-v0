      <h2>Feedback</h2>

      <div id="bryan-feedback">
         <h4>5) Pair programming nodejs architecture</h4>
        <p>Hey Jonathon, here's some feedback for you, airpair and Peter. Have fun at SXSW!</p>

<p>Running a single-person startup is challenging. Learning new technologies by the usual methods (going to meetups, working through tutorials, etc.) are great for general, high-level knowledge, but not particularly good when you need advice about specifics. Finding an expert to discuss best-practices and implementation details is the fastest, most efficient way to get started and avoid costly dead-ends. You know those experts exist, but how can you find them?</p>

<p>The answer: AirPair.</p>

<p>Following a brief description of my project with AirPair, I was able to choose <a hre="http://peterlyons.com/" target="_blank">Peter Lyons</a>, a developer with great credentials and expertise that matched my goals. He was able to quickly translate the requirements from my existing Ruby project into a more streamlined iteration in Node.js. He patiently explained some arcane aspects of Node and cemented the abstract tutorials I had done to real-world examples. Peter followed up the sessions with outlines and code examples--I didn't expect that and really appreciate it now that I'm writing new code. Perhaps the most valuable result is that I now know that my project's overall re-design has been vetted by a professional.</p>

<p>And all of that happened in just three hours over two sessions.</p>

<p>You don't need AirPair if you are extremely well-connected and have lots of industry-leading professional friends who all owe you favors. For the rest of us, there's AirPair. I would highly recommend AirPair to anyone who needs to "rent" expertise, and I am definitely going to use it in the future.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />
