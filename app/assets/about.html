        <h2>AirPair[2] Moving from Rails to NodeJS</h2>
        <h4>Entrepreneur Feedback</h4>
        <p><b>Bryan Hughes:</b> This service is exactly what I was looking for. However, I have no idea how many folks like me are out there.
        Peter was great. I had been researching options for a week and had distilled things down to a few pain points and specific questions. His answers were concrete. It was gratifying to hear that the parts I felt were "wrong" to me were the parts he had good alternative suggestions for.

        <h2>AirPair[1] Socket.io</h2>
        <h4>Entrepreneur Feedback</h4>
        <p><b>David Crawford:</b> Overall I had a good experience and got answers much faster than I could on my own. I learned a lot and got my money's worth.
        <br />
        I was impressed with how quickly Alex understood my architecture and specific challenges.  It's not particularly complicated, but I've encountered a lot of good engineers who can take a while to catch on to a verbal description of how a technology works.  Alex's could be very productive in this session because he could understand my application so quickly.
        <br />
        Overall, I would use the service again, especially if I was confident that I was talking to someone with experience running production systems with similar challenges to mine.</p>
        <h4>Dev Feedback</h4>
        <p><b>Alexandru Vladutu: </b>It's been a great session with David, I think we've covered some
ground in an hour and I'm really pleased with that.<br /><br />

Besides the awesome feeling you have with helping someone (maybe
you've experienced being helped or helping someone on stackoverflow so
you know how it's like), having a video talk is definitely more
productive, as you can share code / tips & tricks and also answer new
questions along the way.<br /><br />

It's the first time I did this and it's been really interesting, I
would do it again if I had the chance.</p>
