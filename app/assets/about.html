          <h2>AirPair[4] NodeJS Web Apps & Mocha Testing</h2>
          <h4>Entrepreneur Feedback</h4>
          <p>Peter was able to quickly translate the requirements from my existing Ruby project into a more streamlined iteration in Node.js. He patiently explained some arcane aspects of Node and cemented the abstract tutorials I had done to real-world examples. Peter followed up the sessions with outlines and code examples--I didn't expect that and really appreciate it now that I'm writing new code. Perhaps the most valuable result is that I now know that my project's overall re-design has been vetted by a professional.</p>
          <h4>Dev Feedback</h4>
          <p>I'm a fan in general of A) startups B) startups for startups and C) connecting people across geographies via the Internet. So overall I think it's a cool service. I like helping entrepreneurs and programmers and this gives me a way to do both.</p>

          <p><b>James Lamont:</b> I enjoyed the Airpair session and would do it again. Josh was a great sounding board and he offered some genuinely helpful ideas for refactoring our controller.</p>
          <h4>Dev Feedback</h4>
          <p><b>Joshua Montross: </b> I appreciate what you are doing. I found the exchange stimulating and enjoyed working with you both.

        <h2>AirPair[2] Moving from Rails to NodeJS</h2>
        <h4>Entrepreneur Feedback</h4>
        <p><b>Bryan Hughes:</b> This service is exactly what I was looking for. However, I have no idea how many folks like me are out there.
        Peter was great. I had been researching options for a week and had distilled things down to a few pain points and specific questions. His answers were concrete. It was gratifying to hear that the parts I felt were "wrong" to me were the parts he had good alternative suggestions for.

        <h2>AirPair[1] Socket.io</h2>
        <h4>Entrepreneur Feedback</h4>
        <p><b>David Crawford:</b> Overall I had a good experience and got answers much faster than I could on my own. I learned a lot and got my money's worth. I was impressed with how quickly Alex understood my architecture and specific challenges.  It's not particularly complicated, but I've encountered a lot of good engineers who can take a while to catch on to a verbal description of how a technology works.  Alex's could be very productive in this session because he could understand my application so quickly.
        Overall, I would use the service again, especially if I was confident that I was talking to someone with experience running production systems with similar challenges to mine.</p>
        <h4>Dev Feedback</h4>
        <p><b>Alexandru Vladutu: </b>It's been a great session with David, I think we've covered some
ground in an hour and I'm really pleased with that.

Besides the awesome feeling you have with helping someone (maybe
you've experienced being helped or helping someone on stackoverflow so
you know how it's like), having a video talk is definitely more
productive, as you can share code / tips & tricks and also answer new
questions along the way.

It's the first time I did this and it's been really interesting, I
would do it again if I had the chance.</p>
