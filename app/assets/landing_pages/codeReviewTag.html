    <h2><em>{</em> What type of problems do our experts find? <em>}</em></h2>

    <p>1. <b>{{ tag.name }}</b> Performance mistakes, including: Excessive database traffic, missing database indexes and sub-optimal design. Memory hungry functions.</p>

    <p>2. <b>{{ tag.short }} Security vulnerabilities</b>, including:
        Unauthorized access to logic that should be protected based on user identity and permissions. Weaknesses that could be subject to scripting and injections attacks. Keys and passwords that should be encrypted.</p>

    <p>3. <b>{{ tag.name }} architectural and {{ tag.short }} best practices</b>, including:
      Inconsistent architecture throughout the project, resulting in increased maintenance costs. Using DRY (don't repeat yourself) approach to minimize overall code and improve consistency. Taking full control of language features and constructs.</p>
    <p>

    <br /><br />

    <h2><em>{</em> Should my project be reviewed? <em>}</em></h2>

      <p>If your project was developed by an outsourced team or you have aggressive performance or scalability goals you will get a lot of benefit out of getting more expert {{ tag.name }} developer checking over quality.

      <p>If some or all of your {{ tag.short }} development team is new to the technology code review is a great way to introduce new skills while improving the quality of your software.</p>


<!--     <h2><em>{</em> Should my project be reviewed? <em>}</em></h2>

  <p>
6.  Can you arrange for multiple reviewers? It is usually not cost-effective to have several experts review the same code simultaneously; the additional defects found rarely justify the cost. However, we will frequently have multiple reviewers inspect a single project; for example a database expert reviews the database, while a different reviewer inspects the architecture and application logic.
