Brian is having problems with images loading slow
you will need to look through his code

Thorsten Heymann  10:27 AM
can you show the code?

me  10:27 AM
I don't have it he does
But you might need to show code too

Thorsten Heymann  10:27 AM
you told that problems arised after migrating the site to new servers.

me  10:27 AM
can you do a screen share now?

Thorsten Heymann  10:28 AM
which screen do you need?

me  10:28 AM
any
I just want to see that you can do it!

Thorsten Heymann  10:28 AM
how can I enlarge you screen?

me  10:29 AM
make the hangout window bigger
you can also up the size of the font...
I still can't see you screen bud?
*your screen
ohhh
sorry Ican
for some reason
the thumbnails
down the bottom do not update for you

Thorsten Heymann  10:30 AM
Ok. Should work. I've shared a terminal

me  10:30 AM
yes I see it
ok ...
I would like to teach you how to take the recording
that way I don't have to be on the call
.... but
it's very important we get the recording
otherwise we can't pay you
-- got it?

Thorsten Heymann  10:31 AM
understand

me  10:31 AM
... you should practice after this call once
------
when you create a hangout
there is a checkbox
"hang out on air"
make sure that is checked

Thorsten Heymann  10:31 AM
understood

me  10:31 AM
then once you're in the hangout
you will see s red button
up the top right
do you see my cursor over it?
"start braodcast"

Thorsten Heymann  10:32 AM
yes

me  10:32 AM
then it will count down from 10 seconds
and start recording (it is now)
just before the end of your session
when you hang up
click "end braodcast"
that's it

Thorsten Heymann  10:33 AM
Ok, got it

me  10:33 AM
great - so ... we got off on the wrong foot with Brian
because we missed the call ...
I am going to introduce you by email
and ask him to fill you in on any more details
so that we can make sure we find his problem
in the session
I'm going to schedule in
for
6am PST Wednesday
and send you a google calendar invite
please reply to that invite
so we all are on the same page with the time

Thorsten Heymann  10:35 AM
Ok. Have a question. Can connect to his servers using ssh too? (if required and got credentials)

me  10:36 AM
Please ask him if he is ok with that in email before hand
