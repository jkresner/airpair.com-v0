We all want to work with JS developers who have good skills in this area. I have a strong understanding of the advanced javascript concepts that you mentioned and how to apply them in real code. I'd like to teach you the pattern of creating objects that Coffeescript uses, as it is my favorite. I can also show you alternatives. I can show you some of the code that I've worked on before in Backbone. If you like, we can do some refactoring work in an open-source project that needs some better OO design applied to it. Hopefully we can get you in good shape for this interview!","expertAvailability":"I'm located on the east coast, which will make evenings the best time for us to pair (unless you like to get up super early).

Memory management and performance are on the table too. The app is composed of a simple Express.js app that allows users to define and launch various crawls of local/intranet file systems. The crawlers need to function as independent CLIs too. The crawlers do a lot of socket.io to communicate their real-time progress back to the Express app, and there's probably too many layers of emitters and listeners going on in some cases.\n\nAnother area that needs work is a scheme to allow the crawlers to act more like plugins to the Express app. For example, if there are 4 crawlers (A, B, C, D) but the app only needs 2 of them (A, C), The Express app's toolbar should only show options for A and C. Seems wrong to have the CLIs carry around jade template baggage for how their forms should look (I'm not doing that, but it seems like the only way to truly make them modular).","budget":90,"canceledDetail":"","company":{"mailBody":"%0A%0A\nWe shortlisted a few experts for your airpair.
