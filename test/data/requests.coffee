There are a few things on this list that I have never attempted such as TDD and javascript. There are also things that I have a little understanding of but am aiming to increase my knowledge/skill-set of the topic.\n\nHere is a list of what I'm wanting to learn more about.\n1. Deployment - I'm interested in being comfortable with heroku deployment, what those add-ons do and when to use them. And also how to get set up with AWS, switch domain names from godaddy to either of these platforms.\n\n2. TDD/BDD - I'm looking to learn best practices, and become comfortable when using either Rspec or Cucumber. Also when are the optimal times to use either one, or both.\n\n3. Refactoring - I've never done this before so just as above, just looking to learn the process and have some fun becoming comfortable with it.\n\n4. Problem decomposition - This is something that I think becomes second nature to a person the more he/she does it. And I could use any pointers or processes that would point me in the right direction as I look to improve this skill over time.\n\n5. Advanced active record - Understanding when its appropriate to use polymorphic associations, then things such as select's, ordering, keeping my database queries fast, etc...\n\n6. CSS - I have the basics down, but I currently possess only a trial and error (i.e. adjusting things non-systematically) knowledge when using it in the past.\n\n7. Github and versioning - I've been making small improvements when using github in the terminal since I've started using airpair, but I would like to continue to grow in this area, and also understand how to implement versioning in my projects.\n\n8. javascript - I'm mostly interested in learning a framework such as Angular.js. Maybe an overview of the framework and how it mixes with rails would be a good first step.","budget":90,"calls":[],"canceledDetail":"","company":{"_id":"51bf21abfbd41b020000000e","contacts":[{"fullName":"Ramon Porter","email":"sirramongabriel@gmail.com","gmail":"sirramongabriel@gmail.com","title":"","phone":"","userId":"51bf1f9566a6f999a465f3c7","pic":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ffp55gKOfJE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/j5d64NLVMNU/photo.jpg","twitter":"sirramongabriel","timezone":"GMT-0400 (EDT)","_id":"521bd1c14336a8020000003f"}],"__v":0,"about":"Lifetime student.\n\nLooking to learn the following Ruby related disciplines with the goal of being qualified to apply for junior ruby/rails developer career opportunities.\n\n1.

I have experience at every level of the web development stack, though I am most proficient at writing software. I care a lot about good object design and am proficient at it, but would not yet consider myself a master. I am a git expert and can recommend best practices and help people out of messes they might be in.","email":"nilbus@gmail.com","gh":{"id":64751,"username":"nilbus","location":"Durham, NC","blog":"www.nilbus.com","gravatar_id":"bd2e27498ad94413dcc5d4d660dd43cf","followers":26},"gmail":"nilbus@gmail.com","homepage":"www.nilbus.com","hours":"1","in":{"id":"U6s-wRzUny","displayName":"Edward Anderson"},"name":"Edward Anderson","pic":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd2e27498ad94413dcc5d4d660dd43cf","rate":110,"so":{"id":87298,"website_url":"http://www.nilbus.com","link":"87298/nilbus","reputation":2652,"profile_image":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd2e27498ad94413dcc5d4d660dd43cf?d=identicon&r=PG"},"status":"ready","timezone":"GMT-0400 (EDT)","tw":{"id":13470092,"username":"nilbus","pic":{"value":"https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1836537085/gravatar_normal.jpeg"}},"userId":"51a6155a66a6f999a465f2f8","username":"nilbus","karma":0,"tags":[{"soId":"ruby-on-rails","short":"ruby-on-rails","name":"ruby-on-rails","_id":"514825fa2a26ea020000002f"},{"soId":"ruby","short":"ruby","name":"Ruby Motion","_id":"514825fa2a26ea0200000031"},{"soId":"git","short":"git","name":"git","_id":"5181d0a966a6f999a465eb40"},{"soId":"vim","short":"vim","name":"vim","_id":"5181d0a966a6f999a465ebaa"},{"soId":"bash","short":"bash","name":"bash","_id":"515207f0eecddf0200000014"},{"soId":"rspec2","short":"rspec2","name":"rspec2","_id":"5181d0ad66a6f999a465f19f"},{"soId":"javascript","short":"javascript","name":"javascript","_id":"514825fa2a26ea020000001f"},{"soId":"jasmine","short":"jasmine","name":"Jasmine","_id":"514825fa2a26ea020000001d"},{"soId":"linux","short":"linux","name":"Linux","_id":"514825fa2a26ea0200000023"},{"soId":"osx","short":"osx","name":"osx","_id":"5181d0a966a6f999a465eb42"},{"soId":"jruby","short":"jruby","name":"jruby","_id":"5181d0ab66a6f999a465eefe"},{"soId":"coffeescript","short":"coffeescript","name":"coffeescript","_id":"514825fa2a26ea0200000011"}],"hasLinks":true},"expertStatus":"available","_id":"521bd39a4336a80200000041","events":[{"utc":"2013-08-26T22:15:54.270Z","name":"first contacted","by":{"id":"5175efbfa3802cc4d5a5e6ed","name":"Jonathon Kresner"}},{"by":{"name":"Edward Anderson","id":"51a6155a66a6f999a465f2f8"},"name":"viewed","utc":"2013-08-27T03:25:29.383Z"},{"utc":"2013-08-27T03:44:43.870Z","name":"viewed","by":{"id":"51a6155a66a6f999a465f2f8","name":"Edward Anderson"}}],"suggestedRate":{"opensource":{"expert":70,"total":90},"private":{"expert":70,"total":110},"nda":{"expert":90,"total":160}},"requestId":"521bd1964336a8020000003d","expertRating":"5","expertFeedback":"I love the rails, git, and devops deployment stuff he's after.

There are a few things on this list that I have never attempted such as TDD and javascript. There are also things that I have a little understanding of but am aiming to increase my knowledge/skill-set of the topic.\n\nHere is a list of what I'm wanting to learn more about.\n1. Deployment - I'm interested in being comfortable with heroku deployment, what those add-ons do and when to use them. And also how to get set up with AWS, switch domain names from godaddy to either of these platforms.\n\n2. TDD/BDD - I'm looking to learn best practices, and become comfortable when using either Rspec or Cucumber. Also when are the optimal times to use either one, or both.\n\n3. Refactoring - I've never done this before so just as above, just looking to learn the process and have some fun becoming comfortable with it.\n\n4. Problem decomposition - This is something that I think becomes second nature to a person the more he/she does it. And I could use any pointers or processes that would point me in the right direction as I look to improve this skill over time.\n\n5. Advanced active record - Understanding when its appropriate to use polymorphic associations, then things such as select's, ordering, keeping my database queries fast, etc...\n\n6. CSS - I have the basics down, but I currently possess only a trial and error (i.e. adjusting things non-systematically) knowledge when using it in the past.\n\n7. Github and versioning - I've been making small improvements when using github in the terminal since I've started using airpair, but I would like to continue to grow in this area, and also understand how to implement versioning in my projects.\n\n8. javascript - I'm mostly interested in learning a framework such as Angular.js. Maybe an overview of the framework and how it mixes with rails would be a good first step.","budget":90,"calls":[],"canceledDetail":"","company":{"_id":"51bf21abfbd41b020000000e","contacts":[{"fullName":"Ramon Porter","email":"sirramongabriel@gmail.com","gmail":"sirramongabriel@gmail.com","title":"","phone":"","userId":"51bf1f9566a6f999a465f3c7","pic":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ffp55gKOfJE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/j5d64NLVMNU/photo.jpg","twitter":"sirramongabriel","timezone":"GMT-0400 (EDT)","_id":"521bd1c14336a8020000003f"}],"__v":0,"about":"Lifetime student.\n\nLooking to learn the following Ruby related disciplines with the goal of being qualified to apply for junior ruby/rails developer career opportunities.\n\n1.
