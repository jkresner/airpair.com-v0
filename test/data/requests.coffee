JavaScript is an amazing language, but is kind of dangerous so test coverage is important, but not at the expense of speed to market.\n\nSinon is a great framework and brunch comes with mocha-phantom support.'

    brief:"Interviewing candidates. We're currently hiring an iOS developer and thus would like someone that has a lot of experience working with the platform to interview candidates and assess their ability, providing recommendations to the CTO on whether to hire. The format of the interview would be 50 minutes carried out over a recorded Google Hangout, thus allowing screen sharing to take place while the candidate conducts a mixture of Q&A alongside live coding and explaining projects they worked on recently. The remaining 10 minutes is reserved to provide feedback to the CTO."
