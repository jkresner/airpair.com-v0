As excitement about testing fades and published best-practices about testing diverge, most programmers feel besieged by the numerous styles and motivations others claim to be Best Practices. What many of us have found is that when a test tries to serve several purposes, its clarity and purpose are completely lost; nobody knows why each test exists or the \"Right Way\" in which to write the next one.\n\nBut there is a way to avoid this trap while managing to write clear, obvious, and useful tests!\n\nI'll detail an approach that prioritizes clarity and consistency by calling for a separate test suite for each of the benefits we hope to gain from testing. To illustrate, we'll break up a traditional monolithic test suite into 5 entirely new types of tests designed to serve a specific team's needs. Attendees will be equipped to reclaim clarity of purpose for their projects by designing custom test suites to fit their particular goals. ",
